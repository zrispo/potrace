potrace
=======

A javascript port of [Potrace](http://potrace.sourceforge.net)

This is a fork of the original potrace.js by <a href="http://www.github.com/kilobtye">kilobtye</a>.
Anything not transparent gets potraced, as opposed to the original implementation that potraces dark colors.
This fork also adds support for loading images from data URLs.
